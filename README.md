# Tip Calculator Project, By Dario Pena

# This tip calculator will divide the food bill by the amount of people paying into the bill.

# The person or persons will first enter their names upon request in the prompt.

# The person or persons will then enter the total amount for the bill in the prompt upon request.

# The person or persons will then enter the tip percentage in the prompt upon request.

# The tip calculator will then divide the bill and output the tip evenly amongst the number of people.
