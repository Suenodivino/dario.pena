# The tip calculator will output on the first line of the terminal, a thank you note to the customer for using the app.

# The tip calculator will output on the second line of the terminal, a well wish to the customer for the enjoyment of his/her meal.

# The tip calculator will ask on the third line for the total bill of the food.

# The tip calculator will output on the fourth line of the terminal, asking for the tip percentage amount.

# The tip calculator will output on the fifth line of the terminal, asking the number of persons splitting the bill.

# The tip calculator will then calculate the total bill, dividing the tip percentage number by 100 as a float or decimal number, adding the resulting number to the bill, and adding a 10% sales tax to the resulting number.

# The tip calculator will calculate the total amount each person will pay by dividing the total bill by the split bill.

# The tip calculator will then round the resulting number that each person will pay as a float with two decimal numbers behind the decimal point.

# The tip calculator will output to the sixth line of the terminal the total bill, including tip and tax.

# The tip calculator will output to the seventh line of the terminal the equal amount that each person will pay as a float, or decimal number.
