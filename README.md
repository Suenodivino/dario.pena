# Tip Calculator Project: "The Tipulator"

# The tip calculator will output on the first line a thank you note to the customer for using the app.

# The tip calculator will output on the second line a well wish to the customer for the enjoyment of his/her meal.

# The tip calculator will ask on the third line for the total bill of the food.

# The tip calculator will ask on the fourth line for the tip percentage amount.

# The tip calculator will ask on the fifth line for the number of persons splitting the bill.

# The tip calculator will then calculate the bill, divide the tip percentage amount as a float by 100, adding the resulting number to the bill, adding a 10% sales tax to the resulting number.

# The tip calculator will output on the sixth line the total amount of the bill by dividing the total bill by the split bill as a float, or decimal number.

# The tip calculator will then round the resulting number that each person will pay with two decimal numbers behind the decimal point.

# The tip calculator will output the equal amount that each person will pay to the terminal as a float, or decimal number.
