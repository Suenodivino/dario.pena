1. The tip calculator will output on the first line of the terminal, a thank you note to the customer for using the app.


2. The tip calculator will output on the second line of the terminal, a well wish to the customer for the enjoyment of his/her meal.


3. The tip calculator will output on the third line, asking for the total bill of the food to be inputted.


4. The tip calculator will output on the fourth line of the terminal, asking for the tip percentage amount.


5. The tip calculator will output on the fifth line of the terminal, asking the number of persons splitting the bill.


The tip calculator will then calculate the *total bill*, dividing the *tip percentage* number by 100 as a float or decimal number, adding the resulting number to the bill, and adding a *10% sales tax* to the resulting number.


The tip calculator will calculate the total amount each person will pay by dividing the *total bill* by the *split bill*.


The tip calculator will then round the resulting number that each person will pay as a float with two decimal numbers behind the decimal point.


6. The tip calculator will output to the sixth line of the terminal the *total bill*, including *tip* and *tax*.


7. The tip calculator will output to the seventh line of the terminal the equal amount that each person will pay as a float, or decimal number.
